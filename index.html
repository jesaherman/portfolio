        <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in Portland Metro area. I grerw up in a small farming town about forty minutes southeast of Portland. I am the oldest of six kids </p>
        
        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>I have a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University. I studied Human Development and Family Sciences with a focus in Child Development. As much as I love the field, it's not the most lucrative. I was told all the time, "It's not about the income, it's about the outcome!" My ultimate goal at the end of Epicodus' program is get an offer at a company, a non-profit or for-profit that is doing some good in the world. I don't want to give up my goal of working in social services, I just think that I need to gain some more skills in order to be paid a living wage while still doing what I set out to do. In the last five years I've workerd as a server, bartender, pre-school teacher, office specialist, teachers assistant, and a childcare provider. I believe that each one of these positions has offered me a unique set of skills (my patience is uncanny) that I will carry into being a good teammate and developer.</p>
