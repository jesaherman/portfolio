                    <p>This is my favorite because it was the very first page that I made. It looks terrible but has some basic elements that I was really excited about. This project uses html and css.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-3">
                <li><a href="https://github.com/jesaherman/shelter">Fish Shelter</a></li>
                    <p>This project is from day three, we worked on creating panels fro the fish and making it look nice. I like this one because of how hard my pair and I worked on it. I think the page is well laid out and the color schemes are nice. This project uses html and css.</p>

                    <p>This project is from day two. The resort page was fun because we learned hot to include multiple pages for the webpage. This project uses html and css.</p>

                    <p>This was day four's project. I like this one because of all the fun I had working with bootstrap. it also makes navigating css a little bit easier! This project uses html and css.</p>

        <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>My name is Jesa Herman, I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in the Portland Metro area. I grew up in a small farming town about forty minutes southeast of Portland. I am the oldest of six kids; there are nine years between me and my youngest sister. We are a mixed family. It was alaways very chaotic when I was growing up but I'm very thankful for all of my siblings and parents now. I think having such a large family and all of us having differences in the way were raised has created a very unique adulthood for us all. I am going to school at Epicodus and when I'm not there I work at Cascade Brewing in southeast Portland.</p>
        
        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>I have a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University. I studied Human Development and Family Sciences with a focus in Child Development. As much as I love the field, it's not very lucrative. I was told all the time, "It's not about the income, it's about the outcome!" My ultimate goal at the end of Epicodus' program is get an offer at a company, a non-profit or for-profit, that is doing some good in the world. I don't want to give up my goal of working in social services, I just think that I need to gain some more skills in order to be paid a living wage while still doing what I set out to do. In the last five years I've workerd as a server, bartender, pre-school teacher, office specialist, teacher's assistant, and a childcare provider. I believe that each one of these positions has offered me a unique set of skills <strong>(my patience is uncanny)</strong> that I will carry into being a good teammate and developer.</p>
        
        <h3>Hobbies and interests:</h3>
